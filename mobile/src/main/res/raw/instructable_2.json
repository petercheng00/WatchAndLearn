Paint each third of your nail with your light yellow, light pink, and light blue. It is okay (almost better) if the coverage is imperfect. This helps to make the effect really look like clouds in the sky! Let dry completely.","3. Take your dark pink polish and get as much of the polish out of the brush as possible when wiping it back and forth on the opening of the bottle (just make sure there is little/no excess of polish). Using light strokes, paint side to side over the edge of the light yellow and light pink. Try to make these colors fade into each other. Do the same with your purple/blue tones towards the top. If you are not satisfied with the blending, I like to take clear polish and, using a good deal of polish, paint over the colors and smudge them together."]},{"step":"Step 3: Creating the basic shapes","photo":[{"text":"","src":"http://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/R9MN/HXVB0KOR/FRNR9MNHXVB0KOR.MEDIUM.jpg","href":"http://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/R9MN/HXVB0KOR/FRNR9MNHXVB0KOR.LARGE.jpg","alt":"Picture of Creating the basic shapes"},{"text":"","src":"http://www.instructables.com/static/img/pixel.png","href":"http://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/I49R/HXVB0KOS/FUMI49RHXVB0KOS.LARGE.jpg","alt":"4.JPG"}],"text":["4.
