If you have not done so already I HIGHLY suggest looking through my earlier drawing Instructables before moving on.The previous Instructables in this series covered the basics of selecting drawing tools, drawing posture, making a straight line, drawing in 2-point perspective, adding shadows and dimension to drawings and simple rendering techniques.Here are my other drawing Instructables:http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-For-Makers/http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-Perspective-For-Makers/http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-Perspective-II-For-Makers/http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-Rendering-For-Makers/","href":"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-For-Makers/"}},{"step":"Step 2: Cutting Shapes","step_photo":"","property5":"Start by exploring the surfaces of a simple form by drawing contour lines. Contour lines are lines that lie on the surface of an object and follow it's perspective.This will help familiarize you with edge transitions and seeing through a form.Keep your drawing large (greater than 3 inches) and make sure the initial shape is accurate.Then draw a continuous line across the surface that explores all sides of the figure. Keep the line in perspective with the sides and only turn at 90 degree angles.\nPractice this alot and try out cylinders too!"},{"step":"","step_photo":"","property5":"One method for manipulating simple shapes to create more complex figures is my cutting away or subtracting material. I like to think of constructing a drawing the same way as sculpting clay. You start with a basic \"block\" of material and then \"find\" your final shape inside by cutting away and adding material as needed. Building complex shapes out of simpler shapes will help keep your perspective accurate and break down the drawing into easy to manage figures. I don't draw a car by starting directly with a \"car\" shape. I draw a car by starting with a car sized rectangle and go from there.Let's start by cutting one of the edges off of a cube.\nNow try it with a cylinder\nKeep practicing different cuts from different angles. You might even want to experiment with adding tone or casting a shadow."}]},"count":4}
