Everyone does it. I got sick of throwing money in the trash and decided to start saving the scraps of bar soap. I melt them down once a quarter or so in a small saucepan and form a few new bars of 'mystery soap' that I then use just like normal soap. Beats ending up in a landfill. Here's how I did it."},{"step":"Step 2: Break the Soap Slivers into Small Chunks, Add Water","step_photo":{"text":"","src":"http://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/1T1D/H0OIVGC0/F8X1T1DH0OIVGC0.MEDIUM.jpg","href":"http://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/1T1D/H0OIVGC0/F8X1T1DH0OIVGC0.LARGE.jpg","alt":"Picture of Break the Soap Slivers into Small Chunks, Add Water"},"text":"Save the soap scraps. I toss them into a drawer in my bathroom and wait until I have about 20 slivers of soap scraps. Personally, I use Ivory and Irish Spring, but you'll also find some Lava scraps in there too. Your preferences may vary, and you may want to separate them out if you're looking for consistency in the bars you make. Me, I don't really care."},{"step":"Step 3: Boil, Gently","step_photo":{"text":"","src":"http://cdn.instructables.com/F68/5ES9/H0OJ21DE/F685ES9H0OJ21DE.MEDIUM.jpg","href":"http://cdn.instructables.com/F68/5ES9/H0OJ21DE/F685ES9H0OJ21DE.LARGE.jpg","alt":"Picture of Boil, Gently"},"text":"Break them into small pieces, about the size of a quarter, and then add about enough water to be visible at the level that the soap slivers are at.
